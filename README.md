# Simple Snake project
### It's my first personal Java project
#### Not much to talk about, everyone knows how snake works, we can hard-code speed size of board and or size of a cell, in future it'll be featured in options
Project spine is adapted from some yt tutorial, but I've used it as opportunity to understand code and be able to edit the code from there
